# image2react package


### This is a very, very early release , NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE


An Atom plugin for an AI Assisted way of generating react components. This is taking the concepts in [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) and taking it to the next steps.

[![AI Assisted way of generating components](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_iiKl0BB6ho/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iiKl0BB6ho)

This plugin to atom enables the developer to Generate React Components ( React Native for now!) with a design of the app that he wants to build. The concept is to use Machine Learning to identify the various components in the image and then combine them together to form the components that constitute that page. This will help the developer in speeding up the process of generating components.

In the future this will expand to more automatic generation - with layout initially ( position and size ) and styling next ( colors, fonts etc ) and later on to higher level components and functionality. More functionality is higher level concepts like facebook oauth if a facebook button is detected, stripe integration if a checkout is detected etc..

The whole concept is to produce a boilerplate that is based on the set of initial images of the app that the developer wants to build. The AI itself is disconnected from the final technology - so these code generations can be written for any framework ( or even language ).

Any help, either in terms of feedback or bugs or suggestions for improvement will be highly appreciated.
